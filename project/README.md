# Personal Finance Analyser

Easily analyse aggregated normalised personal financial data in one place.

To do so, we use the data warehouse and ETL patterns,
then we use Metabase for SQL analysis and data visualisation.
Time-permitting, we use libraries like scikit-learn for advanced analysis
such as categorisations and predictions.
